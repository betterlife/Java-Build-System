Java Build System

- Description

This is a build system for java / web project build upon Apache Ant, the reason why I create this system rather than use maven is 

  - Keep things simply focusing on what I cares
  - Take full control of how things to be done, not only what needs to be done.

Features include

  - Build / Package / Junit test
  - Findbugs
  - PMD
  - Unit test code coverage
  - Generate ctags/cscope tag file.
  - Generate JavaDoc

- Usage

  - Please run ant -p to show all the targets.
